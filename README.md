The objective for this assignment is to create a Food Ordering mobile application using Flutter and Dart. The application consists of options to create order plans with target cost per day, and a field for selecting dates. There is also a food items section to see what items have been added to the plan, and a way to query order plan to see if the food items amounts exceed the target cost for a date you select. Additionally, users can manage food items to add or remove food from the food items list.
